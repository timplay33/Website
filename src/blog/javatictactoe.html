<h2 id="javatictactoe">JavaTicTacToe</h2>
<p>
	Java, a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language and also
	the programming language used for Minecraft, one of the most popular games
	ever.
</p>
<p>
	My first experiences with Java came from creating Modifications (short mods)
	for Minecraft. Even though there were multiple options for visual mod
	creation, I wanted to know how to do it from the roots on.
</p>
<p>
	Aï»¿fter creating multiple mods for Minecraft, I started to wonder how programs
	create their front-end. After a quick search on the internet, I had found the
	<em> javax.swing </em>
	library, which allows you to easily create a front-end to your console app.
</p>
<p>This simple tic-tac-toe game features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Showing current player</li>
	<li>Calculating winner</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The game's source code as well as a build can be found on my GitHub.
