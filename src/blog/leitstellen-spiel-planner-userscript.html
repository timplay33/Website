<p>
	An userscript for the web game
	<a href="https://www.leitstellenspiel.de/"> Leitstellenspiel.de </a>
	. The Planner-script adds&nbsp;the option to plan buildings, which can then be
	built with just two clicks.
</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>
	To use the script, you need to have the
	<a href="https://www.tampermonkey.net/"> Tampermonkey extension </a>
	installed in your browser. Then simply click this link (
	<a href="https://timplay33.github.io/lss-planner.user.js/lss-planner.user.js">
		https://timplay33.github.io/lss-planner.user.js/lss-planner.user.js
	</a>
	) and the Tampermonkey extension should ask you if the script should be
	installed. Press the installation button.

<h3 id="how-do-i-use-the-script">How do I use the script?</h3>
<p>
	The script adds a button to the map. By clicking it, a movable building marker
	will appear. After moving the marker to the desired position, press the save
	button, and a new modal will appear. In this modal, you can set the name, and
	the type and assign one of your build control centers to it. When saved, the
	provided data will be saved to "IndexedDB", a database located in your local
	browser's data. The script will then reload the page. On page load, all
	entries in the IndexedDB will be queried, and a marker will be placed for each
	entry. Each marker has an on-click event listener, which will open a modal
	with the corresponding data. All entries are modifiable through either the
	modal, which opens once a marker is clicked, or the main modal of the script,
	which is accessible through the user dropdown. All entries in the database are
	listed on this modal. You may download a copy of your database as JSON from
	the settings tab of the modal. If required, you may also disable the markers
	based on their type.
</p>
<h3 id="technical-information">Technical information</h3>
<p>
	The script on its own is created in TypeScript, which is then bundled by
	Webpack into a JavaScript file. The userscript file then adds this bundled
	JavaScript file with a script tag to the page.
