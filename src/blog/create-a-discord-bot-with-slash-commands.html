<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Discord account</li>
	<li>A coding editor (for example VS Code)</li>
	<li>Python with pip installed on your PC</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Start up your favorite code editor (in this Tutorial, I'll be using
	<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a>)<br />and open a folder,
	where you want to create your Discord bot. Next up, open a<br />terminal in
	your folder. In VS Code, press on "Terminal" at the top of<br />the program
	and then on "new Terminal".

<p>
	First, we need to install the discord.py library, which allows python to
	communicate with discord.
</p>
<p>To do so, type the following command in the terminal.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">pip3 install discord.py python-dotenv
</code></pre>
<p>
	Now create your main python file, For example “<strong>index.py</strong>”.
</p>
<h3 id="indexpy">index.py</h3>
<p>
	First, we are going to import the required library <strong>os</strong>,
	<strong>load_dotenv</strong> from dotenv and of course
	<strong>discord</strong>
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import discord
</code></pre>
<p>Next we load the environment variables</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># import eviroment variables
load_dotenv()
DISCORD_TOKEN = os.environ.get("DISCORD_TOKEN")
GUILD_ID = os.environ.get("GUILD_ID")
</code></pre>
<p>
	And set the global variables such as <strong>client</strong> which is the
	object of the bot. The client object contains multiple given functions like
	the <strong>run()</strong> function which is used at the end of the program to
	start the bot. The tree object is used to add commands to your bot.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python"># global variables
intents = discord.Intents.default()
client = discord.Client(intents=intents)
tree = discord.app_commands.CommandTree(client)
</code></pre>
<p>
	Next up is the <strong>on_ready()</strong> function, which is executed when
	the bot is fully started and connected to discord in this function we will for
	now sync the command tree (all created commands) with discord (Syncing the
	command tree on start is not recommended for production). The bot will also
	display a message in the console when it is ready.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">@client.event
async def on_ready():
    await tree.sync(guild=discord.Object(id=GUILD_ID))
       print(f'We have logged in as {client.user}')
</code></pre>
<p>
	Even though the bare structure of the bot now done, it will do nothing if you
	try to run it because the bot (client) needs to be executed with:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">client.run(DISCORD_TOKEN)
</code></pre>
<p>The hole <strong>index.py</strong> at this point:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import discord

# import eviroment variables
load_dotenv()
DISCORD_TOKEN = os.environ.get("DISCORD_TOKEN")
GUILD_ID = os.environ.get("GUILD_ID")

# global variables
intents = discord.Intents.default()
client = discord.Client(intents=intents)
tree = discord.app_commands.CommandTree(client)

@client.event
async def on_ready():
    await tree.sync(guild=discord.Object(id=GUILD_ID))
        print(f'We have logged in as {client.user}')
            
client.run(DISCORD_TOKEN)
</code></pre>
<h2 id="environment-variables">Environment variables</h2>
<p>
	Above in the <strong>index.py</strong>, we are loading environment variables,
	but we haven’t created these yet. To do so, create a new file called
	“<strong>.env</strong>”
</p>
<pre><code>
DISCORD_TOKEN="paste your bot token here"
GUILD_ID="paste your guild ID here"
</code></pre>
<p>and paste these lines into it.</p>
<h3 id="obtaining-a-discord-bot-token">Obtaining a discord bot token</h3>
<p>
	To obtain a Discord bot token for your bot, head over to
	<a href="https://discord.com/developers/applications"
		>https://discord.com/developers/applications</a
	>
	and log in with your Discord account. Click at “new Application” and give your
	bot a name.
</p>
<p>
	In the settings, go to “bot” and under Token you have your bot token. This
	token is like a password and should not be shared!
</p>
<h3 id="invite-bot-to-your-discord-server">
	Invite bot to your Discord server
</h3>
<p>
	To invite your bot to your discord server, paste your client ID, which can be
	found at the “General Information” page in the Discord Developer Portal, into
	this link and open it in your web browser.
</p>
<pre><code>
https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=&lt;Paste your Client id here&gt;&amp;permissions=8&amp;scope=bot
</code></pre>
<p>
	This link will allow you to add your bot to your server, while using admin
	permissions for production you should adjust the permissions to needs.
</p>
<h3 id="obtaining-your-guild-id-server-id">
	Obtaining your guild ID (server ID)
</h3>
<p>
	The easiest way to obtain your guild ID is by opening discord web in your
	browser, <a href="https://discord.com/">https://discord.com/</a> and going to
	your server in the URL your guild ID will be the first random string of
	characters and numbers right behind “/channels/”.
</p>
<p>
	Now add your token and ID into the <strong>.env</strong> and try running the
	<strong>index.py</strong>.
</p>
<pre><code>
python index.py
</code></pre>
<p>
	If everything is done correctly, the response “We have logged in as
	Botty#1880” with “Botty#1880” being the name and discriminator of your bot
	should appear after a while.
</p>
<h2 id="adding-a-slash-command">Adding a slash command</h2>
<p>
	To add a slash command, we need to add a function to the command tree. First,
	create an async function called hello like so
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
async def hello():
</code></pre>
<p>Then give and interaction into the functions arguments</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
async def hello(interaction: discord.Interaction):
</code></pre>
<p>
	Next, you can add the code which is run when the slash command is executed.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
async def hello(interaction: discord.Interaction):
    await interaction.response.send_message(f"Hey {interaction.user.display_name}! This is a slash command!", ephemeral=True)
</code></pre>
<p>
	In this example, it’s a simple answer answering to the user who executed the
	command with their name. We also added the “ephemeral=True” argument at the
	end, with makes the answer only visible to the user who executed the command.
</p>
<p>
	Now, to add this function to the command tree, add the following line above
	your function.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
@tree.command(name="hello", description="Tells you that you used a slash command")
</code></pre>
<p>
	This will add the command to discord slash command list with the given name
	and description.
</p>
<p>Finally, run your bot again</p>
<pre><code>
python index.py
</code></pre>
<p>
	and see how it can answer your “/hello” command in any channel the bot has
	access to on your Discord server.
